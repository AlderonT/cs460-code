# CSCI 460 - Operating Systems!

This is the base upstream repository for CSCI 460. 
This repository is mostly intended to contain examples from class and serve as an example Github repository for students. 

## What's Here?

Each week we will likely look at different code examples. 
These code examples help us practice tools we use, help us to understand how an OS implements something, etc. 
Each week a new directory (`weekN`) will be added to help us organize our examples. 

## Getting Started

Easy peasy! *(Assuming you have Git installed on your machine and an Internet connection.)*

Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
cd ~/dir/where/I/work/
git clone git@github.com:traviswpeters/cs460-code.git
cd cs460-code
```

If you do this, you'll want to run `git pull` from time to time so you get updates to this repository. 

## Future

### Fork vs. Clone

You can fork this repository to your personal account at any point if you like. 
You'd really only need to **fork** this public repository if you plan on contibuting back to *this* repository. 
**Fork**ing this repository is not necessary if you just want to view or download examples from class.

**DO NOT PUSH ANY OF YOUR PRIVATE CODE TO THIS REPOSITORY!**

If you do choose to **fork** this repo, you can either edit files in your **fork** of this public repository via the web interface (this may be easier/safer). 
Alternatively, you can **clone** your **fork**ed copy to your local system and work with it there. 

### Register Your Private Repo

We may adopt a similar approach to using Github repositories as CSCI 366 has done. Specifically:

Please add a file to `/repos` named

```
<YOUR NET ID>.txt
```

that contains the git URL of your private repository, e.g.

```bash
git@github.com:1cg/cs460-fall2020-private.git
```

And then create a pull request against this repository.

We will accept the pull request, and your private work repo will be registered for the class at that point.
