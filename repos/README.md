_This directory contains an administrative mapping between NetIDs and GitHub handles/private repositories._

In your forked copy of the class repo (the public version), please add a file to the `/repos` directory that is named
```
<YOUR NET ID>.txt
```
with the git URL of your private repository.

For example, if I were a student with the NetID `W43m513` and my GitHub username was `studentIAm`
I would add a file named `W43m513.txt` to `/repos` with the following line:
```
git@github.com:studentIAm/csci-460-fall2020-private.git
```

And then create a pull request against this repository.

We will accept the pull request, and your private work repo will be registered for the class at that point.
